Herwig + POWHEG analysis interface for lepton initiated processes
The following should work on a linux system
(this has been tested on a MacOs system and, so far, it does not work) 

0) If it is not in your standard LHAPDF installation, you should install the LeptonPDF (LUXlep-NNPDF31_nlo_as_0118_luxqed). 


Read carefully the Herwig.in infile. You should be able to adapt it to your needs. The essential sections are
- PDFs:
set /Herwig/Partons/RemnantDecayer:AllowLeptons Yes
set /Herwig/Particles/e-:PDF /Herwig/Partons/NoPDF
set /Herwig/Particles/e+:PDF /Herwig/Partons/NoPDF

In particular you may want a different analysis section.
Our setup is such that we can use our powheg analysis. We do it as follows:

1) Compile the POWHEG-Herwig interface by Silvia and Tomas
- Modify the available Makefile in the obvious way ( update paths for the  BOX folder, the process folder and the
analysis source and add customary dependeces if required, check the paths to ThePeg, Herwig and HepMC)
- compile
$ make

- This generates the dynamic library powhegHerwig.so

2) Run Shower+Analysis 
- Create a folder (lets say testrun) with the powheginput file and the lhe events. The dynamic library powhegHerwig.so
must be in ../testrun
- Copy into the folder the new Herwig.in  template and
the hw7.sh shell script (modified version  under herwig-mod directory).
- Modify the number of events to be generated in the Herwig.in file
set EventGenerator:NumberOfEvents 20000 -> set EventGenerator:NumberOfEvents XXX
and check the name of PDF. 

- To run
$ ./hw7.sh
from testrun directory
